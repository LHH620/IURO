The dataset is zhihurec, a public dataset released by THUIR

This is the old version of zhihurec released by THUIR. And IURO used this old version.

The new version: https://github.com/THUIR/ZhihuRec-Dataset

Of course, the old version is the same as the new version, only with a small difference in ID.
You can replace this old version with the new version by some small changes (including the process of xx_ID and the structure of log).
